# project-syl

This repository hosts a GitHub Pages site that aggregates the latest news from Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, with Stormlight Archive updates featured first.

The site lives in the `docs/` directory and fetches Brandon's blog feed at runtime. Posts from the past year are retained and paginated in the history view.

To view the page after enabling GitHub Pages for the `docs/` folder, visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/project-syl/`.
